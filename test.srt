1
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,220
<i>Welcome to Gattaca.</i>

2
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,490
You keep your workstation so clean.

3
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:29,955
<i>- It's next to godliness.
- Godliness ...</i>

4
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:34,918
I reviewed your flight plan. Not
one error in a million keystrokes.

5
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:40,299
Phenomenal. It's right that someone
like you is taking us to Titan.

6
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:45,179
Has the committee approved the
mission? There's talk of delay.

7
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:50,392
You shouldn't listen to talk.
You leave in a week.

8
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:54,855
You've got a substance test.

9
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,556
<i>If you have to take a substance
test, report to the testing centre.</i>

10
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:42,027
Jerome. Never shy.
Pisses on command.

11
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:46,949
- A beautiful piece of equipment.
- You tell me every time I'm here.

12
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:54,748
I see a great many in my job.
Yours happens to be exceptional.

13
00:06:55,916 --> 00:07:00,879
Why didn't my folks
order one like that for me?

14
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:19,940
- Have I ever told you about my son?
- No.

15
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,443
Remind me to, sometime.

16
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,740
So you're about to go up.
One week left.

17
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:33,453
Please tell me
you're the least bit excited.

18
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:38,876
I'll tell you
at the end of the week.

19
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,347
Congratulations, Jerome.

20
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,643
Thank you.

21
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:03,108
How many launches are there
in a day? A dozen?

22
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:10,240
- Sometimes more.
- Only you watch every one of them.

23
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:18,499
If you're going to pretend
like you don't care, don't look up.

24
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,710
<i>The most unremarkable of events.</i>

25
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,924
<i>Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1 st Class,
is about to embark -</i>

26
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:33,180
<i>- on a one-year manned mission
to Titan, the 14th moon of Saturn.</i>

27
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:39,269
<i>This highly prestigious assignment
was guaranteed Jerome at birth.</i>

28
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:47,611
<i>He has all the gifts required.
A genetic quotient second to none.</i>

29
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:53,242
<i>There's nothing remarkable about
the progress of Jerome Morrow.</i>

30
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,162
<i>Except that I am not Jerome Morrow.</i>

31
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:10,592
<i>I was conceived in the Riviera.
Not the French Riviera.</i>

32
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,887
<i>The Detroit variety.</i>

33
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:20,060
<i>They used to say that a love child
has a greater chance of happiness.</i>

34
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,438
<i>They don't say that any more.</i>

35
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:28,694
<i>I don't know
why my mother trusted God -</i>

36
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,989
<i>- rather than her local geneticist.</i>

37
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:39,538
<i>Ten fingers, ten toes, that's all
that used to matter... Not now.</i>

38
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:46,211
<i>Only seconds old, the ex act time
and cause of my death was known.</i>

39
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:56,096
Neurological condition, 60%,
manic depression, 42% probability.

40
00:09:56,263 --> 00:10:01,059
<i>Attention deficit disorder,
89% probability. Heart disorder ...</i>

41
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:07,482
<i>... 99% probability.
Early fatal potential.</i>

42
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:14,072
- Life expectancy: 30.2 years.
- 30 years?

43
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,621
<i>- The name for the certificate?
- Vincent Anton.</i>

44
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,876
That's a good name.

45
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:33,467
I know he'll do something.
You'll do something.

46
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:43,185
<i>I quickly thought of myself
as others did. Chronically ill.</i>

47
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:47,481
<i>Every skinned knee and runny nose
was treated as a fatal threat.</i>

48
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:54,780
<i>The insurance won't cover it. If he
fell ... There's nothing I can do.</i>

49
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:08,418
<i>Like most other parents then,
they wanted their next child -</i>

50
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:13,382
<i>- to be conceived in what
has become the natural way.</i>

51
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,678
Your extracted eggs, Marie, -

52
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:22,641
- have been fertilized
with Antonio's sperm.

53
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,605
We have screened two healthy boys
and two very healthy girls.

54
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:33,277
Without predispositions
to any inheritable diseases.

55
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:41,076
Let's select the most compatible
candidate. What gender do you want?

56
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:47,499
We would want Vincent
to have a brother to play with.

57
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:56,133
<i>You have specified hazel eyes,
dark hair and ... fair skin.</i>

58
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,970
I've eradicated
prejudicial conditions:

59
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:06,894
Premature baldness, alcoholism,
propensity for violence, obesity.

60
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,064
<i>We didn't want ...
Diseases, yes, but ...</i>

61
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,235
We would like to leave
a few things to chance.

62
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:21,325
Give your child the best start. We
have enough imperfection built-in.

63
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:27,498
Your child doesn't need any
additional burdens. It's still you.

64
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,751
Simply the best of you.

65
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:35,797
You could conceive naturally 1,000
times and never get such a result.

66
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:44,181
<i>That's how Anton came to be.
A son worthy of my father's name.</i>

67
00:12:55,817 --> 00:13:01,907
- I'm proud of you, son.
- See how much he's grown.

68
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,215
<i>When we played blood brothers -</i>

69
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:22,302
<i>- I understood my blood was
very different from Anton's.</i>

70
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:28,559
<i>I'd need a lot more than a drop
if I was going to get anywhere.</i>

71
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:52,082
<i>We played chicken.
When our parents weren't watching -</i>

72
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:58,380
<i>- we'd swim as far out as we dared
and see who'd turn back first.</i>

73
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,772
Come on, you coward!

74
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,860
<i>Of course it was always me.</i>

75
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:25,616
<i>Anton was the stronger swimmer
and had no excuse to fail.</i>

76
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:33,624
300 million,
350 million, 400 million.

77
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:38,962
<i>Maybe it was my love of the planets
or just my dislike for this one, -</i>

78
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:44,384
<i>- but for as long as I remember
I've dreamed of going into space.</i>

79
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:50,307
750 million,
800 million, 850 million.

80
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:56,480
How many astronauts are there?
I bet I could be one if I wanted.

81
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,900
Don't eat that. It's Pluto.

82
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:09,785
<i>My goals didn't change a lot.
Much to my parents' dismay.</i>

83
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:13,205
<i>Vincent ...</i>

84
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:21,713
<i>Be realistic. With
a heart condition like yours ...</i>

85
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,595
- There's a chance my heart's fine.
- One chance in 100.

86
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:33,725
- I'll take it.
- They won't.

87
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:38,522
You've got to understand something.

88
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,613
You'll only get inside a spaceship
to clean it.

89
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:54,997
<i>He was right. I lied on my resume,
but my real resume was my cells.</i>

90
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,750
<i>Why waste money on training me -</i>

91
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:03,338
<i>- when there are 1, 000 other
applicants with a cleaner profile?</i>

92
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:07,968
<i>It is illegal to discriminate.
"Genoism", it's called.</i>

93
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,013
<i>But no one takes the law seriously.</i>

94
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:23,108
<i>If you refuse to tell, they take
a sample from a door handle -</i>

95
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:28,989
<i>- or a handshake. Even the saliva
on your application form.</i>

96
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,576
<i>A legal drug test can become-</i>

97
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:38,874
<i>- an illegal peek
at your future in the company.</i>

98
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:49,510
Sure you want to do this?
You know you're going to lose.

99
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,357
<i>It was the last time we swam
together. Out into the open sea.</i>

100
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:10,113
<i>Knowing each stroke out was one
we'd have to make back.</i>

101
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:28,090
<i>But something was different. Every
time Anton tried to pull away -</i>

102
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,386
<i>- he found me right beside him.</i>

103
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:38,100
<i>Until finally
the impossible happened.</i>

104
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,310
Vincent!

105
00:17:55,534 --> 00:18:00,164
<i>For once in our lives Anton was
not as strong as he believed -</i>

106
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:05,586
<i>- and I was not as weak. That
made everything else possible.</i>

107
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:55,928
<i>Like others in my situation I moved
around getting work where I could.</i>

108
00:18:56,136 --> 00:19:00,599
<i>I must've cleaned
half the toilets in the state.</i>

109
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:06,939
<i>The underclass wasn't determined
by social status or skin colour now.</i>

110
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:13,487
<i>- Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
- Today discrimination is a science.</i>

111
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:19,243
There's your cleaning material.
Start here and clean to the back.

112
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,163
I want to see my smiling face
on that floor.

113
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:36,218
Dreaming of space, Your Majesty?

114
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:39,471
Come here.

115
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,561
Start by cleaning this space.

116
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,653
<i>I knew how far away I was from my
goal when I stood right beside it.</i>

117
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:11,438
- Don't clean the glass too well.
- What do you mean?

118
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,274
You might get ideas.

119
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:19,821
But if the glass is clean, it'll be
easier to see me on the other side.

120
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:16,003
<i>I knew it was just brave talk.
No matter how much I studied, -</i>

121
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,841
<i>- the best test score in the world
needs a blood test to match it.</i>

122
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:26,805
<i>I had to go to extreme measures.</i>

123
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:31,685
<i>The man who came didn't exactly
advertise in the Yellow Pages.</i>

124
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,396
Stand straight.

125
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:39,318
- How did you hear about me?
- People.

126
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:44,823
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birth marks?

127
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,534
No.

128
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:52,372
Are you serious about this?
I hope you're not wasting my time.

129
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:58,086
- I'd give 100%.
- That'll get you halfway there.

130
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:04,843
That's an old edition,
but I know it all by heart.

131
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:12,267
- The commitment is binding.
- You have somebody in mind?

132
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:39,920
<i>For the genetic elite, success
is attainable, but not guaranteed.</i>

133
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:44,299
<i>There is no gene for fate.</i>

134
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:49,763
<i>And when a member of the elite
falls on hard times -</i>

135
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,268
<i>- their genetic identity
becomes a valued commodity.</i>

136
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,312
<i>One man's loss is another's gain.</i>

137
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:01,233
He's got impeccable credentials.
An unbelievable expiration date.

138
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:12,077
He'll practically live forever.
His IQ is off the register.

139
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:18,959
Better than 20/20 vision. Strong
heart. He could run through a wall.

140
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:27,092
If he could still run.

141
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:31,388
He was a big-time swimming star.

142
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:37,978
You could go anywhere with this
guy's DNA tucked under your arm.

143
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:46,486
- You look so right together.
- We don't look anything alike.

144
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:52,826
Nobody looks at photos today.
Christ, you could have my face.

145
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:58,790
- How do I explain the accident?
- It happened out of the country.

146
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:06,006
No one knows he broke his back. He's
still a fully productive citizen.

147
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:12,012
- Just fill in his last year.
- You're a foreigner.

148
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,684
They don't care where you were born.
Blood has no nationality.

149
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:22,439
As long as it's got what they want,
it's the only passport you'll need.

150
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:29,863
- Who lives up there?
- Well, I certainly don't.

151
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:34,159
<i>The process of becoming him began.</i>

152
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:38,705
<i>Myopia is one of the most obvious
signs of a disadvantaged birth.</i>

153
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:43,627
- Isn't there another way?
- Surgery will leave scars.

154
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:47,923
It's contact lenses or a white cane.

155
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,719
- Besides, the colour doesn't match.
- He's right.

156
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:56,723
My eyes are prettier.

157
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:01,353
I take 25% of all you make.

158
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,567
If it fails, all this equipment
must be returned in seven days.

159
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:10,904
- And you lose your deposit.
- Wait! You said 20%.

160
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:14,158
- 20%.
- It's not negotiable.

161
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:35,679
- I guess that's it.
- No. There's still the height.

162
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:41,185
How tall were you
before the accident?

163
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:47,107
- His profile says he's 6' 1 ".
- I can wear lifts.

164
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:53,739
Even with lifts
you're not that tall.

165
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,284
So what?

166
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,082
<i>No ...</i>

167
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:11,215
- We never discussed that.
- I thought you were serious.

168
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:15,511
I am. I'm not doing that.

169
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,807
No.

170
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:30,234
<i>Now Jerome knew I was committed.</i>

171
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,155
<i>I endured the pain by reminding
myself that when I did stand up -</i>

172
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,493
<i>- I'd be exactly two inches
closer to the stars.</i>

173
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:47,876
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Do you want to go dancing?

174
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:55,092
You had to be a right-hander.
No one orders southpaws any more.

175
00:27:56,593 --> 00:28:01,807
Jerome Morrow. It's a nice name.

176
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:08,021
- It's my name.
- I can't be you without it.

177
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:12,317
What makes you think
you can be me at all?

178
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,703
Look at this.

179
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,374
- Look at it.
- It's nice.

180
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:35,799
- Is it real?
- Are you colour-blind? It's silver.

181
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:41,346
Jerome Morrow was never meant
to be one step down on the podium.

182
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:48,687
With all I had going for me,
I was still second best.

183
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:54,401
Me!
So how do you expect to pull it off?

184
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,574
I don't know, exactly.

185
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:07,206
Your signature needs work.

186
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:10,250
<i>Soon we were put to the test.</i>

187
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:17,090
<i>Jerome had the genes to get
into Gattaca, but not the desire.</i>

188
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:22,679
- Do you really want to be in there?
- Not in there. Up there.

189
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:30,771
- What's up there?
- That's want I want to see, Jerome.

190
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:36,735
Call me Eugene. My middle name.

191
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:41,990
If you're going to be Jerome,
you better start getting used to it.

192
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:56,129
- I must go. Where's my sample?
- In the fridge. Door on the left.

193
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:01,802
- Which pouch?
- Any of them.

194
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:09,142
- You think I should test it?
- If you like.

195
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:21,155
- What's wrong with the machine?
- You've been drinking again!

196
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:26,118
- I haven't.
- Christ, it's eight in the morning!

197
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,046
This is no joke.
My interview is in an hour!

198
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:49,683
- There's more vodka than piss!
- I had half a glass to celebrate.
